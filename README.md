# Profiles app feedback

### Ealilan Mathivannan:  
* For the employment section there is no option for being currently employed.
* Allow more characters for project title.
* Add a Volunteering Section to Employment history and rather than ‘custom section’ it could be additional achievements or Hobbies.
* A way to know you are reaching your character limit.


### Eduardas Verba:  
* Make course text limit bigger  
* Have a selection where you could choose if you have a uni degree or not  
* after creating a project have a button to quickly add another one instead of going all the way back to the projects page. - or just send back to the projects page instead.  
* ADD edit button next to destroy as clicking the name isn't intuitive and it doesn't look like a link thought it was just colored text. so instead just have: Destroy | edit  
* have the description box to auto expand, don't like the look of it being 2 line and I have to scroll. even when I have half of the screen empty bellow the descrption box.  
* when in mobile view, have log-out on the same line as the hamburger glyphicon, show the name only when ther nav bar is expanded. this is because the name takes up space which makes it look like you have 2 navbars.  
* add a feature where you could order your projects.  
* ... add a correct character count to description... make it clear it counts the title too.  

### Hanad Ahmed:  
What I felt could be improved is that in the summary the character count could be increased as there was only 600 character available and that is including spaces and full stops, commas and so-forth.

Another thing which i felt could be improved was in education the next box after institution which was course only allowed you to put in one course at a time. So if you wanted to put in your educational history your high school history you would need to list out every single subject as you did many different course whilst in high school and filling in the exact same thing but changing the courses ten times is not very effective nor efficient.

Lastly, i didn't understand why the profile page had to be the last thing to be filled out. Usually you would fill out the summary and move your way forward to employment history and so forth. Having it this way makes it difficult for the user as there isn't any helpful popup boxes telling you to complete the other sections first.

Projects

*  the size of the title of the project is not resizable.  
    * When you type a title that’s outside the borders of the input box you cant see anything beyond the very few first letters of the word at maximised display. In minimised form you only see few letters of the first words

Education
* description (maybe all description input fields)
    * They lack basic input formatting such as font sizes- bullet points makes it harder to try and list the modules for the degree done.
    * Display after the save shows as one long paragraph. Losing any formatting or blank spaces used to try to format a reasonable display

* text

### Logaraj Sivachelvan:  

Copy and paste function does not work on the summary section
Some of the title boxes in the pages are quite small, so hard to know any mistakes that might have been made while typing
Cannot enter the current employment as it requires  the end date


### Mhaventhan Arunthavalingam:  
* text

### Nattinan Oukongka:  
*  It's simple and easy to use, but not very well designed.
*  Instructions are not very detailed i.e. on the Education section, it should be specified what type/level of educations should be provided.
*   Profile isn't very well-formatted.
*   No formatting options, even the custom section is not customisable i.e. you should at least be able to change text sizes.
*   In the responsive mode, the Profile page isn't very well presented. The summary section should be cut off, and just display the first few lines as it doesn't look very attractive; it looks cluttered.
*   The way the "Approved Profiles," "Pending Profiles," "Rejected Profiles," and "Draft Profiles" are listed isn't a very appealing; it looks awkward. Maybe have them in a drop-down menu option somewhere visible, like on the same line as Profile but set to the right?

### Oceane Lonneux:  
* No skills or interests section? contact section? Languages?
* Characters don't decrease as we type (some sections do, but not most of them).
* More characters in some sections as projects or skills would be nice.
* !!! No way to have 'present' in dates. We have to put a defined day.
* A nicer website would be great, as some more options (bullets points, bold, ...).


### Reece Collett:  
* Allow more characters for the summary as some previous summaries, such as my own, might be incompatible with the current amount of allowed characters.
* Allow for lists to be inputted or created.
* When bullet points are added, they don't appear on the document as a formatted list, just a paragraph with some bullet points in the middle.
* Allow for longer certification titles.
* Text boxes for titles of certifications need to be larger to be able to see all or at least most of what has been entered.
* Have a section for the initial information such as summary, degree and stream (maybe all in the same section) for consistency.
* When trying to submit my profile from draft to pending, the app said that there was an error. When I recreated the profile and saved it as pending first, It again came up with an error. It saved it as pending this time so I am not sure if an error occurred at all.

### Tasneem Mahmud:  
* The profiles app is very easy to use and very simple. Just working on the 'adding text' section may be easier if it would expand and we could see more clearly on what we had written.

### Viren Mistry:  

* When using the profiles app, what I found good about the app was....
 * The apps was easy to use.
 * All the headings allowed me to access all the webpages
 * Page is nicely laid out
 * All links work.

* What I think needs improving was...
  * The Certificate and Custom section title field needs to have a longer field width, for I can not see a lot of what I typed.
  * Fields need a popup tab to say what to put inside the field, just incase someone is stuck on what to say.
  * Not all elements are resizable within the application.
